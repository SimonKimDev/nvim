# Neovim Configuration
This is my Neovim setup largely based and expanded on Josean Martinez's [blog post](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-neovim-2024) and the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pAG3BHurdM)

Other than small retouch the setup is virtually identitcal to Josean's setup, checkout his video for more detailed explanation on the setup.
